                <img src="img/3818763.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of
                    which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
                    three stumps. <br><br>


                    <span id="md-heading">Method of Playing </span> <br>The batting side scores runs by striking
                    the ballbowled at the wicket with the bat
                    (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this
                    (by preventing the ball from leaving the field,
                    <br> and getting the ball to either wicket) and
                    dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). <br> Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball
                    hits
                    the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is
                    hit by the bat, but before it
                    hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of
                    the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings
                    ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and
                    match referee in international matches.
                    They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

                    <span id="md-heading">Forms of Cricket </span> <br>

                    Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to
                    Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers
                    play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours.
                    In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the
                    ball, which is a hard,
                    solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core
                    layered with tightly wound
                    string.

                    <span id="md-heading">Limited Over Cricket</span>
                    <br>

                    Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it
                    was sure to produce
                    a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased.The first Limited
                    Overs International
                    was played in 1971 and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential,
                    staged the first limited overs
                    Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, made an
                    immediate impact.[citation needed]
                    On 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th ICC full members, enabling them to
                    play Test cricket.</p>
